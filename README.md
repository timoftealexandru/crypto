### Permutation cipher

 Create a project with the following features:

(i) A graphical interface. The user will be given the possibility to choose the characters of the alphabet to be used out of the blank and the 26 letters of the English alphabet. The implicit alphabet will have all the 27 characters.

(ii) Given an encryption key and a plaintext, encrypts the plaintext. There will be a key validation and a plaintext validation.

(iii) Given an encryption key and a ciphertext, computes the decryption key and then decrypts the ciphertext.
